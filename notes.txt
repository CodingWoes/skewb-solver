Four different operations. See Skewb Square sketchup file

Each operation can be done clockwise or anticlockwise around the selected corner.

We'll use only the top corners (C0-C3), as the bottom corners mirror their top counterparts.

USE - (C0) F / F' -> Front corner clockwise / Front corner anticlockwise
USW - (C1) L / L' -> Left corner clockwise / Left corner anticlockwise
UNE - (C2) R / R' -> Right corner clockwise / Right corner anticlockwise
UNW - (C3) B / B' -> Back corner clockwise / Back corner anticlockwise

[bottom corners]
DSE - C4 front
DSW - C5 left
DNE - C6 right
DNW - C7 back

(F0) Up
(F1) South
(F2) East
(F3) West
(F4) North
(F5) Down
3 operations in the same direction returns the cube to its original state.

2 operations in one direction are the same as doing 1 operation in the opposing direction.
